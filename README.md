# semantic-search-rs

navie semantic search demo with gRPC server in Rust

## Goals

* cost-effective billion-scale vector serach in a single digit latency (< 10 ms)
* stateless vector searcher
* software & hardware-level optimizations to effectively utilize the resources

## Non-Goals

* distributed & sharded index building & searching
* quantize & reduce the embedding dimension
* support various indexing algorithms

### real thing does matter

To serve billion-scale vector search in real-time, effectively, there're two things to be achieved, followed by [this post](https://0x65.dev/blog/2019-12-07/indexing-billions-of-text-vectors.html).

1. vector
    * reduce vector size
    * quantize vector
2. offload the index (to the local disk)
    * to save memory

## To-Do

* [x] modify hnswlib-rs
  * [x] re-implement distance calculation (L2, Cosine) with SIMD (more effective, x2 faster)
  * [x] resolve build issue
* [ ] memmap the `.data` (offload to the local disk) to reduce the memory usage
* [ ] separate embedding and search part as a different micro service
* [ ] (optional) hybrid HNSW-IF indexing

## Architecture

### Features

* gRPC server
* dynamic batch inference (both of model & search)
* inference a LM in a real time on the GPU.
  * model info : [hf - Mini-LM L12 v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2)
* ANN (modified hnswlib-rs)
  * multi-threaded insertion and search.
  * SIMD accelrated distance calculation. (re-implemented)
  * HNSW (FLAT) index

### Data

* Input  : query. String.
* Output : top k indices. list of int32.

## Requirements

* libtorch 2.0 (cuda)
* rust-bert
* (modified) hnswlib-rs
* protobuf

## Run

### Build index

Extract embeddings from the given documents and build & save an index to the local disk.

```shell
make run-builder
```

### gRPC Client

Run gRPC client.

```shell
make run-client
```

### gRPC Server

Run gRPC server (for model & search inference).

```shell
make run-server
```

### Example

Run example with the given query. (there must be a built index with `ag_news` dataset)

```shell
cargo +nightly run --release --features example --bin main "query"
```

## Benchmarks

* GPU : GTX 1060 6G (CUDA 11.8, CuDNN 8.8.x)
* CPU : i7-7700K
* Info
  * compiled with `AVX2`, `FMA` flags (RUSTCFLAGS)
  * indexing : HNSW (FLAT)
  * embedding dimenstion : 384
  * distance measure : L2, Cosine
  * k : 10
  * warm up with 10 times
